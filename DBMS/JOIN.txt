Sure, here are the corrected SQL queries without the expected outputs:

1. Get PNO and PNAME values for Parts priced Less than 20.
```sql
SELECT P.PNO, P.PNAME FROM PARTS P WHERE P.PRICE < 20;
```

2. Get PNO values for parts for which orders have been placed.
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT P.PNO FROM PARTS P INNER JOIN ODETAILS OD ON P.PNO = OD.PNO;
```

3. Get all details of the customers whose names begin with the letter 's'.
```sql
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS C LEFT OUTER JOIN ZIPCODES Z ON C.ZIP = Z.ZIP WHERE C.CNAME LIKE 'S%';
```

4. Get the ONO and CNAME values for customers whose orders have not yet shipped.
```sql
SELECT O.ONO, C.CNAME FROM ORDERS O INNER JOIN CUSTOMERS C ON O.CNO = C.CNO WHERE O.SHIPPED IS NULL;
```

5. Get CNAME and ENAME pairs such that the customer with name CNAME has placed and ordered through the employees with ENAME.
```sql
SELECT C.CNAME, E.ENAME FROM CUSTOMERS C INNER JOIN ORDERS O ON C.CNO = O.CNO INNER JOIN EMPLOYEES E ON O.ENO = E.ENO;
```

6. Get the name of Employees who were hired on the earliest date.
```sql
SELECT ENAME FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE HDATE = (SELECT MIN(HDATE) FROM EMPLOYEES);
```

Here are the corrected SQL queries without the outputs:

1. Retrieve the Part number, part name, and price with price greater than 20000 in ascending order of PNO.
```sql
SELECT P.PNO, P.PNAME, P.PRICE FROM PARTS P WHERE P.PRICE > 20000 ORDER BY P.PNO ASC;
```

2. For each part, get PNO, PNAME values along with total sales.
```sql
SELECT P.PNO, P.PNAME, COALESCE(SUM(OD.QTY), 0) AS Total FROM PARTS P LEFT JOIN ODETAILS OD ON P.PNO = OD.PNO GROUP BY P.PNO, P.PNAME;
```

3. Get the total Qty of parts 10601 that have been ordered.
```sql
SELECT SUM(OD.QTY) AS Total FROM ORDERS O LEFT OUTER JOIN ODETAILS OD ON O.ONO = OD.ONO WHERE OD.PNO = 10601;
```

4. Get the ENO values of Employees from city "Mumbai".
```sql
SELECT E.ENO FROM EMPLOYEES E INNER JOIN ZIPCODES Z ON E.ZIP = Z.ZIP WHERE Z.City = 'Mumbai';
```




Here are the corrected SQL queries:

1. Get the names of all teachers who teach 'Thermodynamics'.
```sql
SELECT T.TName AS Name
FROM TEACHER T
INNER JOIN TAUGHTBY TB ON T.Tid = TB.Tid
INNER JOIN SUBJECTS S ON S.SubNo = TB.SUBNO
WHERE T.Dept = 'Physics' AND S.Subtitle = 'Thermodynamics';
```

2. Rename the subject 'DBNS' to 'RDENS'.
```sql
UPDATE SUBJECT SET Subtitle = 'RDENS' WHERE Subtitle = 'DBNS';
```

3. Find out all students who stay in Kolkata and whose roll number is between 20 and 25.
```sql
SELECT ROUND, SName, City
FROM STUDENT
WHERE City = 'Kolkata' AND ROUND BETWEEN 20 AND 25;
```

4. Display all the students' information in the order of their roll numbers who stay in 'Kolkata'.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM STUDENT
WHERE City = 'Kolkata'
ORDER BY ROUND;
```

These queries should execute without error and provide the desired results.
