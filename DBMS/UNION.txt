Here are the corrected SQL queries:

1. Selects all different cities (only distinct) from the Customers and Suppliers tables:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT City FROM Customers 
UNION 
SELECT DISTINCT City FROM Suppliers;
```

2. Select all cities from the Customers and Suppliers tables:
```sql
SELECT City FROM Customers 
UNION ALL 
SELECT City FROM Suppliers 
ORDER BY City;
```

3. Select all German cities from the Customers and Suppliers tables:
```sql
SELECT City, Country 
FROM Customers 
WHERE Country = 'Germany' 
UNION 
SELECT City, Country 
FROM Suppliers 
WHERE Country = 'Germany' 
ORDER BY City;
```

4. Select all customer names and supplier names from Customers table where the city name is common in both tables:
```sql
SELECT c.CustomerName AS Customer_Name, c.City AS City, s.SupplierName AS Supplier_Name 
FROM Customers c 
JOIN Suppliers s 
ON c.City = s.City;
```

5. Select all country names from Supplier table which don't have any customer in the Customers table from its own country:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Country 
FROM Suppliers 
WHERE Country NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers);
```
