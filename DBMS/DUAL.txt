Here are the corrected SQL queries:

a) Retrieve the current date and time in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS".
```sql
SELECT TO_CHAR(SYSDATE, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') AS "DATE-TIME" FROM DUAL;
```

b) Multiply 2 by 2.
```sql
SELECT 2 * 2 AS "Multiplied value" FROM DUAL;
```

c) Find the absolute value of -15.
```sql
SELECT ABS(-15) AS "ABSOLUTE VALUE" FROM DUAL;
```

d) Calculate the square root of 5.
```sql
SELECT SQRT(5) AS "SQUARE ROOT Value" FROM DUAL;
```

e) Round off 15.19 to one decimal point.
```sql
SELECT ROUND(15.19, 1) AS "ROUND-OFF VALUE" FROM DUAL;
```

f) Display the name "IVAN BAYROSS" in lowercase.
```sql
SELECT LOWER('IVAN BAYROSS') AS "LOWERCASE" FROM DUAL;
```

g) Display the name "IVAN BAYROSS" in UPPERCASE.
```sql
SELECT UPPER('IVAN BAYROSS') AS "UPPERCASE" FROM DUAL;
```

h) Add 5 months to the present date.
```sql
SELECT ADD_MONTHS(SYSDATE, 5) AS "DATE" FROM DUAL;
```

i) Display the number of months between '2001-JAN-01' and '2001-JUL-01'.
```sql
SELECT MONTHS_BETWEEN(TO_DATE('2001-JUL-01', 'YYYY-MON-DD'), TO_DATE('2001-JAN-01', 'YYYY-MON-DD')) AS "Months" FROM DUAL;
```

j) Print the system date in the particular format DD/MM/YYYY.
```sql
SELECT TO_CHAR(SYSDATE, 'DD/MM/YYYY') FROM DUAL;
```

These queries should execute without error and provide the desired results.
